#Grade Master.

This project aims to create “GradeMaster”, a web-based platform using the Django web framework that enables efficient communication between teachers and parents. The platform allows teachers to input and update students’ academic performance data, attendance, remarks, and other relevant information. 

At the same time, parents can view their child's progress in real-time and receive notifications about their academic performance and attendance. The project uses database concepts to store and manage student data securely. The goal is to enhance communication and collaboration between teachers and parents, leading to improved student academic outcomes. 

The platform will be designed using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Bootstrap which will provide a user-friendly and visually appealing interface for all users. The project will also incorporate features to ensure data security and confidentiality.

The team will use the Django web framework, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap to design a visually appealing interface for teachers and parents. Additionally, the platform will leverage the FullCalendar content delivery network to facilitate the marking of student attendance records. 

SQLite will be used as the database management system for efficient and secure data storage and retrieval. JQuery will also be used to enhance the user experience and streamline user interactions. The platform will undergo rigorous testing and refinement to ensure it meets the requirements and standards of all stakeholders.
